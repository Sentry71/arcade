The Story
---
The program leads for Udacity's Front End Web Developer nanodegree, Miriam Swords Kalk and Michael Wales, are having a conversation the day before the nanodegree is set to open. It seems, however, that there are a few things missing. Miriam and Mike need YOUR help to collect the missing course materials and get the nanodegree program off to a great start. Can you help?

Game Play
---
- Collect the books on the game board, while avoiding the bugs that are running across the screen.
- Take the books to the top of the screen, and drop them into an open tile without a book.
- If the player character is hit, the character will switch and start again.
+ (For example, if Mike is hit, Miriam will be next for our player to control.)
- If a character is carrying a book when he/she is hit, the book will be dropped where the character collided with the bug.
- When all five books are on the top of the screen, the player wins!
