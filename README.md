The Story
---
The program leads for Udacity's Front End Web Developer nanodegree, Miriam Swords Kalk and Michael Wales, are having a conversation the day before the nanodegree is set to open. It seems, however, that there are a few things missing. Miriam and Mike need YOUR help to collect the missing course materials and get the nanodegree program off to a successful start. Will you help?

Game Play
---
- Pick up the book on the game board, while avoiding the bugs that are running across the screen.
- Take the book to the top of the game board, and drop it onto an open tile by moving onto that tile. Books can be placed in any order.
- If the player character is hit, the character will alternate and gameplay will start again. (For example, if Mike is hit, Miriam will be next for the player to control.)
- If a character is carrying a book when he/she is hit, the book will be dropped where the collision occurred.
- When all five books are at the top of the screen, the player wins!
